# A tool for better roadmaps

We've all used bad tools for making roadmaps.

What would a good tool look like? What opinions would it embody?

## Plan work in time-limited cycles

Now, next, later - but with dates.

Say what you plan to do by a deadline. At the deadline, review what's happened and what hasn't, and then replan. Don't extend the deadline.

Communicate what you are doing if becomes clear you can't do everything you said you would. 

Change plans if better plans become available.

The tool gives you "now", "next" and "later" boxes, with dates attached to them. It doesn't give you a blank year planner to draw how long you think something will take.

Break things up into bits.

## Think ahead, but commit responsibly

Things you're working on should be part of a long term plan. But it doesn't make sense to commit to doing specific work in 12 months' time - or in 6 months, or even 3.

Better ways to achieve plans may emerge or unexpected things may happen.

Plan to achieve longer term goals. But the tool will present anything you're not working on "now" in a way that does not imply a firm plan to work on it until you actually are working on it.

Once you're working on something "now", focus on it. Change direction at the end of the cycle.

## Long term plans should work on small sized screens

No left to right scrolling. Time flows vertically down the page.

Things are grouped by when they are happening and who's working on them, so you can resize a page without losing information.

(And you can look at it on a phone on the bus, and it will still work. You want people who are often busy to be able to read your thing.)

## This is not your issue tracker

People make plans, not tools.

Wanting to understand what a team is doing from day to day at standup is a really different to wanting to know how the software they're working on would be best changed over time to meet longer term goals.

Handling the link between the two is best done by a set of activities involving clear communication, judgement, domain knowledge, honesty and mutual trust - often grouped together under the term "management". Replace that with a dashboard at your peril.

The tool is more like a content management system (CMS) for presenting longer term plans - to yourself and others. It gives you a specific place to link to your team's work in progress board if that's what people are interested in.

To visualise work in progress for your team, use any of the many services which let you list stages of a proccess and track a thing as it moves through them.

## The tool should not get in your way

Beyond how the previous points are literally getting in your way.

The tool understands:

+ a roadmap, ie your roadmap not someone else's
+ a "cycle", ie "now", "next" or "later"
+ an "item" - a thing on your roadmap

...and it will (currently) bump the dates of a roadmap's cycles, so "now" is always the eighth of a year (6 week cycle) you're in when you look at it - it's up to you to move things in and out of this "active state". 

Other than that it doesn't do a lot. You could use it for grouping any old list into three lists if you wanted to.
