## Timebox work, accountably

Now, next, later - but with dates. Work iteratively, in time-limited cycles.

Break work up into achievable bits.

## Commit responsibly to future plans

Things in "next" aren't in "now" until the situation demands it - and you decide that it does.

But a space to reference, and plan for, longer term goals.

## Roadmaps that work on mobile

No left to right scrolling. Time flows vertically down the page.

Your audience are busy people. They should be able to look at your plan on the bus.

## The panopticon is an anti-pattern

Separate your team's work in progress board from your long term planning documents.

Specificly link to the board you look at in standup, if people want to see that - but it's not a data source to power your roadmap.

## Tools should not get in your way

Three lists of things you want to do: now, next, and later. (And some dates).

The rest is up to you.
