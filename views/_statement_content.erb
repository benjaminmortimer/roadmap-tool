<h1 id="a-tool-for-better-roadmaps">A tool for better roadmaps</h1>

<p>We’ve all used bad tools for making roadmaps.</p>

<p>What would a good tool look like? What opinions would it embody?</p>

<h2 id="plan-work-in-time-limited-cycles">Plan work in time-limited cycles</h2>

<p>Now, next, later - but with dates.</p>

<p>Say what you plan to do by a deadline. At the deadline, review what’s happened and what hasn’t, and then replan. Don’t extend the deadline.</p>

<p>Communicate what you are doing if becomes clear you can’t do everything you said you would.</p>

<p>Change plans if better plans become available.</p>

<p>The tool gives you “now”, “next” and “later” boxes, with dates attached to them. It doesn’t give you a blank year planner to draw how long you think something will take.</p>

<p>Break things up into bits.</p>

<h2 id="think-ahead-but-commit-responsibly">Think ahead, but commit responsibly</h2>

<p>Things you’re working on should be part of a long term plan. But it doesn’t make sense to commit to doing specific work in 12 months’ time - or in 6 months, or even 3.</p>

<p>Better ways to achieve plans may emerge or unexpected things may happen.</p>

<p>Plan to achieve longer term goals. But the tool will present anything you’re not working on “now” in a way that does not imply a firm plan to work on it until you actually are working on it.</p>

<p>Once you’re working on something “now”, focus on it. Change direction at the end of the cycle.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-plans-should-work-on-small-sized-screens">Long term plans should work on small sized screens</h2>

<p>No left to right scrolling. Time flows vertically down the page.</p>

<p>Things are grouped by when they are happening and who’s working on them, so you can resize a page without losing information.</p>

<p>(And you can look at it on a phone on the bus, and it will still work. You want people who are often busy to be able to read your thing.)</p>

<h2 id="this-is-not-your-issue-tracker">This is not your issue tracker</h2>

<p>People make plans, not tools.</p>

<p>Wanting to understand what a team is doing from day to day at standup is a really different to wanting to know how the software they’re working on would be best changed over time to meet longer term goals.</p>

<p>Handling the link between the two is best done by a set of activities involving clear communication, judgement, domain knowledge, honesty and mutual trust - often grouped together under the term “management”. Replace that with a dashboard at your peril.</p>

<p>The tool is more like a content management system (CMS) for presenting longer term plans - to yourself and others. It gives you a specific place to link to your team’s work in progress board if that’s what people are interested in.</p>

<p>To visualise work in progress for your team, use any of the many services which let you list stages of a proccess and track a thing as it moves through them.</p>

<h2 id="the-tool-should-not-get-in-your-way">The tool should not get in your way</h2>

<p>Beyond how the previous points are literally getting in your way.</p>

<p>The tool understands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a roadmap, ie your roadmap not someone else’s</li>
  <li>a “cycle”, ie “now”, “next” or “later”</li>
  <li>an “item” - a thing on your roadmap</li>
</ul>

<p>…and it will (currently) bump the dates of a roadmap’s cycles, so “now” is always the eighth of a year (6 week cycle) you’re in when you look at it - it’s up to you to move things in and out of this “active state”.</p>

<p>Other than that it doesn’t do a lot. You could use it for grouping any old list into three lists if you wanted to.</p>
